## Points to Consider

- Typing
  - Static vs. dynamic typing
  - Strictness (e.g. Rust vs. TypeScript)
  - Inference
  - Types available beyond the primitives
  - Type sizing and signing (e.g. `i32` vs. `u32` vs. `f64` in Rust)
- Structures
  - Classes/structs, enums, traits/interfaces, generics, etc.
- Paradigm
  - Functional, imperative, object-oriented, etc.
- Standard library scope
  - All-encompassing (Java), or minimal (C)
- Syntax
  - Special syntax for standard library structures (e.g. Java vs. Python)
  - Syntactic sugar (e.g. `if let` and blocks with only one expression in Rust)
- Control flow
  - Loops, conditionals, match/switch statements, etc.
- Operators
  - Overloading
- Error handling
  - Monadic (Rust), exception-based (Java, Python etc.), etc.
- Null value
  - No distinction (Java), checked (Swift - `T?` may be of type `T` or `nil`), none, etc.
